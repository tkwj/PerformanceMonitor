## Notice Regarding GPLv3 Component

Performance Monitor includes an **optional integration** with sp_WhoIsActive, which is licensed under GPLv3. This integration:

- Is **optional**: Performance Monitor functions without sp_WhoIsActive installed
- Does not modify sp_WhoIsActive source code
- Calls sp_WhoIsActive as an external tool when available
- Does not create a derivative work of sp_WhoIsActive

Users who choose to install sp_WhoIsActive must comply with the GPLv3 license terms for that component. Performance Monitor itself remains under its separate license.

If you have concerns about GPLv3 compatibility in your environment, you can:
1. Skip sp_WhoIsActive installation during setup
2. Use alternative query monitoring approaches
3. Contact Darling Data, LLC for guidance
